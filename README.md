# great_expectations
Let us understand how to validate, document, and profile your data to maintain quality and improve communication between teams. It helps us understand what to expect from the data we load and transform, and catch any data issues quickly. With the help of Great Expectations, we can also create data documentation and data quality reports from basically creating unit tests for given data. 
When new data is ingested from any source, it can be transformed as part of the data pipeline and to ensure its correctness, we validate data. This allows us to prevent data quality issues. 

## Expectations
What are Expectations?
Expectations are assertions about your data. And how do you define an assertion. For example, we use assertions to check a particular condition is always true or if any values stray from it. Great Expectations library currently provides over 300 built-in Expectations, and additionally you can write custom Expectations.
